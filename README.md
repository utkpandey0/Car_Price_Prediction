# Car_Price_Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the selling price of used cars based on various features such as brand, model, year of manufacture, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, and more. The main objective is to build a machine learning model that can estimate the fair market price of a car, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

We use a dataset containing historical car listings, preprocess it to handle missing values and categorical features, and then apply regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest Regressor to train predictive models.

To evaluate performance, we use metrics such as RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE). A simple web interface is also created using Gradio, allowing users to input car details and get an instant price prediction.
